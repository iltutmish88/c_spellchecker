Here, you'll get a spellchecker program in c language. It can perform three important tasks:

1. It can detect misspelled words from an input paragraph
2. It can display those misspelled words with their word positions in the console
3. It can suggest 5 suggestive correct spellings for each of the misspelled words
4. For giving suggestions, it uses some advanced algorithms and functions like Levenshtein Distance, Soundex, Appearance and qsort
5. It formats the output screen very preciously
